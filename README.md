Deepfake Detection System
This project provides a robust solution for detecting deepfakes using advanced machine learning techniques. Deepfakes refer to AI-generated synthetic media where a person in an existing image or video is replaced with someone else's likeness. This system aims to identify and flag manipulated content, ensuring the authenticity of media in a growing world of synthetic content creation. Key features include:

AI-Powered Detection: Utilizes state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to analyze and detect inconsistencies in videos and images that suggest deepfake manipulation.
Facial Analysis: In-depth facial movement analysis, including micro-expressions, eye blinking, and skin texture to identify unnatural patterns.
Multimodal Detection: Combines visual, audio, and metadata analysis to increase detection accuracy for video deepfakes.
Real-Time Detection: Capable of identifying deepfake content in real-time, suitable for live video streams or video uploads.
Scalable Architecture: Designed for large-scale implementation, capable of processing vast amounts of media data efficiently.
User-Friendly Dashboard: Provides clear insights into detection results, highlighting suspicious areas in the media content.
This project aims to tackle the growing challenge of deepfake media and ensure the integrity of visual and audio content across platforms.
